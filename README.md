# Dockerfile for GCC for Renesas RX series.

The source codes are distributed by [Open Source Tools for RENESAS](https://llvm-gcc-renesas.com/).

This repository is meant to be used as a toolchain for [Tinyusb](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) RX targets.


I have tested the following environment and confirmed that it works properly. However, `GitHub Actions` reports a failure, so I have no idea.
